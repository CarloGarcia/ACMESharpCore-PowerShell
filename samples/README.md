# Samples

Some samples depend on each other, since most will need an existing state and acme account.
All used variables will be defined on top of the scripts.

If you want to know more about the used commands, refer to `Get-Help`

## Create an new account [./CreateAccount.ps1]

The sample will create a state object, an account key and register an account with the acme service.
